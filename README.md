GST Percentage Lister 2025
A web-based application to list and manage Goods and Services Tax (GST) percentages for 2025, providing an easy-to-use interface for businesses and individuals to access updated GST rates.

About The Project

The GST Percentage Lister 2025 is designed to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform for accessing and managing GST rates for the year 2025. The application allows users to view, search, and filter GST percentages for various goods and services, ensuring compliance with the latest tax regulations.
Why there is a need for this:

GST rates change frequently, and businesses need a reliable source to stay updated.
Manual tracking of GST percentages in spreadsheets is prone to errors and inefficiencies.
No user-friendly, browser-based tool exists to quickly access and manage GST rates for 2025.

This project aims to streamline GST rate management with a modern web interface, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
